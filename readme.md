WanderBits
==========

A simple text-based adventured game.

WanderBits is a game of adventure in the classic sense. Remember Zork? I sure do! I remember learning about it in high
school and being completely mesmerized by the entire concept. It was like reading a book with which you could interact
directly. I could never get enough of those games!

The game of WanderBits is the story of a young man on a quest to explore his world. We don't know the name of this
person, or where he comes from. The world he lives in right now is a bit of a puzzle. It's made of up curiously-connected
rooms, but some of the doors are locked and with no key in sight. There must be a key somewhere around? Maybe in that
pot over there? Maybe under the carpet? Hmmm??? We must help this poor fellow find his way out of this game so he can
continue on with his life!
